text1: Hi, I’m Diana, a STEM enthusiast with a background in Computer Science and Business. I’m deeply fascinated by neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and behavior design. I’m fascinated by how habit formation, mental models, and cognitive biases influence our decisions and behaviors. As an entrepreneur at heart, I thrive on solving complex problems, designing innovative solutions, and exploring how technology intersects with the science of human behavior.
